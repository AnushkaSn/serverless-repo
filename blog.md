## About Me
Hello! I am Anushka Nilangekar, a rising sophomore doing my Bachelors in Computer Science at Purdue University. I am from the United Arab Emirates. In my free time, I like watching netflix, doing karaoke, and listening to music. I am really excited to create a personal project through the Serverless camp!
